# Portfolio

Web Development Portfolio

- I was motivated to work on this project that I can later use in seeking employment in the field of web development. The project required the use of mockup language and how to write a README document, such as this one, as well as htmlpreviously taught new coding practices and was thereby challenging and useful in learning these new techniques.

## Installation

- In this second module of the coding bootcamp course, I will use html elements, css selectors, including media queries, flexbox properties, responsive design, css resets, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, transitions, typography, and css variables, as well as the techniques from the previous modules.

- I will create an electronic portfolio that provides my name and recent profile picture with links to sections about me, using flexboxes and media queries to provide a dynamic and responsive web page.

## Usage

- For use as a means of storing notes for further study, the user adds lines of code with their notes in the various notes sections.
