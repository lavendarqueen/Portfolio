        <p>
          My family has several "computer types" and I have always been
          fascinated with computers. My mother was a computer programmer in the
          days before the PC, programming mainframe computers that used punch
          cards for input! My son took web development in high school and his team won tournaments. He has worked in IT for over 10 years and is currently a
          systems administrator. My nephew is the CEO of a web development company that he owns today, having started out as a web developer and business management student.
        </p>

          At age 18, I took my first computer course consisting of Cobol and
          RPG2. Later in life, I took some courses in html, CSS, JavaScript,
          and Bootstrap. My life has taken many turns since then but my fascination with computers has never waned. Things in the world of computers have changed a lot since then, so I enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp through the University of Denver. After graduation, I look forward to working in this cool and fascinating field.
