        <p>
          My family has several "computer types" and I have always been
          fascinated with computers. My mother was a computer programmer in the
          days before the PC, programming mainframe computers that used punch
          cards for input! My son took web development in high school and his
          team won tournaments. He has worked in IT for over 10 years and is
          currently a systems administrator. My nephew is the CEO of a web
          development company that he owns today, having started out as a web
          developer and business management student.

          At age 18, I took my first computer course consisting of Cobol and
          RPG2. Later in life, I took some courses in html, CSS, JavaScript, and
          Bootstrap. My life has taken many turns since then but my fascination
          with computers has never waned. Things in the world of computers have
          changed a lot since then, so I enrolled in the Full Stack Web
          Development Bootcamp through the University of Denver. After
          graduation, I look forward to working in this very cool and
          fascinating field.
