        <p>
          I have always been fascinated with computers. My mom was computer
          programmer in the days before the PC, programming mainframe computers
          that used punch cards! At age 18, I took my first computer course
          consisting of Cobol and RPG2. Later in life, I took some courses in
          HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. My life took many turns but my
          fascination with computers never waned. Things in the world of
          computers has changed a lot so I am currently studying a Full Stack
          Web Development Bootcamp through the University of Denver. After
          graduation, I look forward to working in the field.
