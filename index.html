        <p>
          My family has several "computer people" and I have always been
          fascinated with computers. My mother was computer programmer in the
          days before the PC, programming mainframe computers that used punch
          cards! My son took web develpment in highschool and went to tournaments. He has worked in IT for over 10 years and is currently a
          systems administrator and my nephew is CEO of a web development
          company that he owns today, having started out as a web developer and
          a business management student.
        </p>

          At age 18, I took my first computer course consisting of Cobol and
          RPG2. Later in life, I took some courses in html5, CSS, JavaScript,
          and Bootstrap. My life has taken many turns but my fascination with
          computers never waned. Things in the world of computers have changed a
          lot since then, so I enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development
          Bootcamp through the University of Denver. After graduation, I look
          forward to working in this cool and fascinating field.
