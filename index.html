        <p>
          My family has several "computer types." I have always been fascinated
          with computers. My mother was a computer programmer in the days before
          the PC, programming mainframe computers that used punch cards for
          input! My son took web development in high school and his team won
          tournaments. He has worked in IT for over 10 years and is currently a
          systems administrator. My nephew is the CEO of a web development
          company, having been a student in web development and business
          management.

          I took my first computer course consisting of Cobol and RPG2 when I
          was 18 years old. Later, I took online courses in html, CSS,
          JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
        </p>

          Having worked as a paralegal for a number of years, I decided to
          change career paths. I wanted to expand my web development skills and
          put them to good use. I enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development
          course through the University of Denver. As a recent graduate of the
          program, I am ready to begin my journey in this very interesting
          field.
