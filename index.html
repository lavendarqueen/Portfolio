        <h2>Work Portfolio...Coming Soon!</h2>
        <p>My family has several "computer  people" and I have always been fascinated with  computers. My mother was computer programmer in the days before the PC, programming mainframe computers that used punch cards!  
          My son has worked in IT for 10 years and is currently a platform engineer and my nephew is CEO of a web development company that he owns today, having started out as a web developer and a business management student.  
          <p>At age 18, I took my first computer course consisting of Cobol and RPG2.  Later in life, I took some courses in html5, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.  My life has taken many turns but my fascination with computers never waned.  Things in the world of computers have changed a lot since then, so I enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp through the University of Denver.  After graduation, I look forward to working in this interesting field.</p>
